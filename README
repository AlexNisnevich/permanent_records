PermanentRecords
================

This plugin prevents any of your records from being destroyed casually.
Any model with a deleted_at datetime column will have that column set rather than being deleted.

Usage
=======

    User.find(3).destroy          # sets the 'deleted_at' attribute to Time.now and returns a frozen record
    User.find(3).destroy(:force)  # executes the real destroy method, the record will be removed from the database
    User.delete_all               # bye bye everything (no soft-deleting here)

There are also two named scopes provided for easily searching deleted and not deleted records:

    User.send :with_deleted { User.find(:all) }     # only returns deleted records.
    User.send :with_not_deleted { User.find(:all) } # you guessed it.


Is Everything Automated?
=======

Yes. You don't have to change ANY of your code to get permanent archiving of all your data with this gem. 
When you call 'destroy' on any record  (or 'destroy_all' on a class or association) your records will
all have a deleted_at timestamp set on them.

Can I easily undelete records?
=======

Yes. All you need to do is call the 'revive' method.


    User.find(3).destroy
    # the user is now deleted
    User.find(3).revive
    # the user is back to it's original state

And if you had dependent records that were set to be destroyed along with the parent record:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      has_many :comments, :dependent => :destroy
    end
    User.find(3).destory
    # all the comments are destroyed as well
    User.find(3).revive
    # all the comments that were just destroyed are now back in pristine condition


Patches welcome, forks celebrated.
